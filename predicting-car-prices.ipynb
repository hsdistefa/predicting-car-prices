    "# Predicting Car Prices Using Machine Learning\n",
    "In this notebook we will be predicting a car's market price using its attributes using a simple machine learning workflow. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. We will use these attributes to create a model that can give a good idea of a cars market value given only the attributes of a car it hasn't seen before.\n",
